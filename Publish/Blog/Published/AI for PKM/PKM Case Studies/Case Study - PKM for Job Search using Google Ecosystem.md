## Problem
Goals
- How can I manage multiple job applications?
- Need to manage generic & (multiple) application-specific infos
Info & Knowledge (INK)
- All the docs in Google Drive
- Gemini answers can be exported to Google Drive
AI Skills
- Mostly ChatGPT
- A bit of Gemini CLI
## Solution
Google Drive as backend
- Generic: generic resume / generic interview tips
- Specific: tailored resumes / position-specific interview feedback

NotebookLM as intelligence layer
- Each application has a notebook
	- Containing generic & specific INK
- General knowledge notebook is kept separately
	- Combining position-specific tips into general knowledge

### Additional Lessons
Markdown-based solution (e.g. Obsidian) is not always the answer
- Syncing GDoc <→ Markdown could be more hassle than needed

Try meeting recorder for increased learning from interview sessions
- Plaud or other meeting recorder apps
