## Summary
Building a Second Brain (BASB) presents the CODE methodology (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express) for personal knowledge management. Tiago Forte argues that our biological brains are optimized for having ideas, not storing them, and proposes a systematic approach to externalize knowledge using digital tools.

## Key Concepts
- **CODE Framework**: Capture what resonates, Organize for actionability, Distill to essence, Express to create value
- **PARA System**: Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives - organizing information by actionability rather than topic
- **Progressive Summarization**: Layered highlighting technique to distill knowledge gradually
- **Intermediate Packets**: Reusable building blocks of work that accumulate value over time

## Notable Quotes
> "Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them."
> — Core principle of externalizing knowledge

> "We should organize our knowledge not by subject, but by the projects and goals we are actively pursuing."
> — Foundation of the PARA method

## Relevance to AI4PKM
BASB established the modern PKM framework that AI4PKM builds upon. The CODE methodology maps directly to AI-enhanced workflows: AI agents can automate Capture (ingestion), assist with Organization (tagging/linking), accelerate Distillation (summarization), and enhance Expression (content generation).

The PARA system provides the foundational structure for organizing both human and AI-generated knowledge in a vault, ensuring actionability remains the primary organizing principle.
