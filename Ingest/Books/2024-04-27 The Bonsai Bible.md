## Highlights
Hard pruning is done on an untrained tree or shrub to create the framework of the future bonsai, and on a tree that needs reshaping because it has lost its form. It is best undertaken in spring or mid-summer, when the tree will heal readily. Further refining the tree with wiring will make it look even better ([Location 312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B00MTXJDKY&location=312))

To achieve the authentic, white, bleached effect seen on some bonsai, apply lime sulphur or bleach to the dry, dead wood. Once the driftwood effect has been created, the wood should in any case be preserved by applying lime sulphur to the wood once or twice a year when the weather is dry.

With most bonsai, fertilizer should be applied only during the growing season. If plants are given nutrients when they are not growing, the fertilizer will be wasted or it will encourage growth at the wrong time of year and cause stress to the tree.

Early spring is the best time for repotting outdoor bonsai: the trees are about to start into growth, and any cuts made to the roots will heal quickly and new roots will soon grow. Should a bonsai pot break in the middle of the growing season – if it is blown over or accidentally knocked – put it into a larger pot and wait until the following spring to repot the plant.
