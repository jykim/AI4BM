## Highlights
Vescovo, who is also a former commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, told me that the mentality required in exploration, the military, and investing is more similar than you might think. “It’s risk assessment and taking calculated risks,” he said. “And then trying to adapt to circumstances. I mean, you can’t be human and not engage in some degree of risk-taking on a day-to-day basis, I’m just taking it to a different level.”

Successful risk-takers are cool under pressure. They don’t try to be heroes, but they can execute when the chips are down.
Being calm when other people lose their shit is a rare quality—and one that’s essential for a winning gambler.

When there’s a stadium full of people, you have to remind yourself [of] standard basic control. Don’t try to do too much. If I do my job, and everyone does their job, we should be all right. Don’t try to go rogue and make a play in front of seventy thousand [people] to be a hero.”
Don’t try to be a hero—just do your job.

The vital point here is not that Einhorn wasn’t feeling the heat. In fact, as we learned in chapter 2, financial risk-taking triggers an innate physical stress response, a fight-or-flight reaction not so different from when we find ourselves in physical danger. This can cause people unfamiliar with the feeling to go on tilt. But if you’ve been under this sort of pressure before, and have the gift of being cool under fire, you’ll be able to think clearly despite it

Successful risk-takers have courage. They’re insanely competitive and their attitude is: bring it on.
In poker and sports betting, the vast majority of players lose money. You have no choice but to be toward the top of your field; otherwise you won’t make money at all. And to be at the very top requires a careful balance. Overconfidence can be deadly in gambling, but playing poker against the world’s best players is not for the faint of heart.
“There’s an extreme correlation that to be able to play against the best every day, and to be a world-class player, it takes a lot of hubris,” said Scott Seiver, a former world number one in the Global Poker Index. “You have a lot of self-confidence to be a top one hundred poker player. It’s just mandatory; you really have to have it baked into you.”

Successful risk-takers have strategic empathy. They put themselves in their opponent’s shoes.
Okay, so people who take high-stakes gambles are competitive, courageous, and cool under fire. No big shockers there. But they also have another trait that I wouldn’t have had on my list going into this project. It came up again and again in different contexts: empathy.

I’m speaking of adversarial situations like poker—or war. McMaster spoke to me about the importance of strategic empathy, a term he attributed to the military historian Zachary Shore’s book A Sense of the Enemy. McMaster thinks military planners often lack this

sense, what the war looks like to the enemy on the ground.

Cuban’s best heuristic is to look at the company from the entrepreneur’s perspective. “I tend to have a good feel for what a business needs to do to be successful. And so I can sit there and listen to their pitch, put myself in their shoes as if it was my company, and ask the [difficult] questions that I would need to deal with,” he said.

Successful risk-takers are process oriented, not results oriented. They play the long game.
“Don’t be results oriented” is a mantra well-known to every poker player. We’ve all taken thousands of coolers and bad beats, situations where we played our hand exactly right, the odds were in our favor, and we didn’t get the result we wanted. Yes, in the long run, results are what count, and one nice thing about the River is that our compensation ultimately depends on objective measures and not the hand-waving vagaries of the Village.[*7] But the long run can take a long time indeed—so in the meantime, we focus on our process.

Successful risk-takers take shots. They are explicitly aware of the risks they’re taking—and they’re comfortable with failure.
There’s a meme from the American version of The Office where the endearingly imbecilic boss, Michael Scott, has misappropriated a quote from the hockey player Wayne Gretzky, scribbling his own name beneath Gretzky’s on a dry-erase board under Gretzky’s quote “You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.”

“There’s a classic moment, two days before launch, where you have your final visit with your family,” Sullivan recalled. “I took my brother aside, and flat out told him, ‘Look, I know the day after tomorrow, I’m getting on top of a bomb. And wanting my friends to light it. I get that, I’m riding a bomb.’ ” But Sullivan knew exactly what she was doing. “If something goes really horribly ugly, wrong, don’t be tearing yourself up that I didn’t know,” she told her brother. “I knew. I knew and I’m here. Because I believe in the purpose, I believe the value of what we’re doing here to the country, to mankind.”

Successful risk-takers take a raise-or-fold attitude toward life. They abhor mediocrity and they know when to quit.
I’d have my MGM Rewards Platinum card revoked if I didn’t quote from Kenny Rogers at some point in this book:
You’ve got to know when to Hold’em, know when to fold ’em
Know when to walk away and know when to run
—Kenny Rogers, “The Gambler”

We probably don’t want everyone in society taking long-shot wagers. But we do want some people willing to risk everything on bets that can have a huge payoff to society.
This is an attitude that distinguishes the United States from much of the rest of the world. “Here, you say, ‘Hey, how do I go for 100x return on my money and not worry about the 3x?’ ” said Vinod Khosla, the founder of Khosla Ventures, which invests in long-shot technologies from artificial meat to artificial intelligence.

Successful risk-takers are prepared. They make good intuitive decisions because they’re well trained—not because they “wing it.”
What most annoyed Vescovo about Top Gun: Maverick was Tom Cruise’s insistence that you should just trust your gut and improvise your way out of a hairy situation. “The best military operations are the ones that are very boring, where things go exactly according to plan. No one’s ever put in any danger,” he said. “You want to minimize the risks. And so yeah, Top Gun, it looked great on film. But that is not how you would try and take out that target.”

Training, ironically, is often the best preparation to handle the situations that you don’t train for. “Apollo Thirteen is the best example where you had really well-trained astronauts in an incredibly bad situation,” Vescovo said, referring to the moon landing that was aborted after an oxygen tank ruptured, disabling life-support and other critical systems—but the astronauts made their way back to Earth safely.

The best players will study solvers so much that their fundamentals become automatic,” he wrote—the complex System 2 solutions that computers come up with make their way into your instinctual System 1 with enough practice. That frees up mental bandwidth for when you do face a hairy situation, or a great opportunity. Now, less experienced players need to be careful with this—Galfond recommends that most players simplify their strategy to focus on executing well. Conversely, the very best players may have some room for maverickness, taking advantage of their relative comfort with the situation.

Successful risk-takers have selectively high attention to detail. They understand that attention is a scarce resource and think carefully about how to allocate it.
If you’ve been around the poker scene long enough, you’ve probably heard the aphorism “Poker is hours of boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.” It describes one of the unusual features of poker: most of the time, you don’t have anything you have to do exactly.

On the one hand, especially when in one of the most dangerous phases like launch, reentry, or a spacewalk,[*11] you want to be focused on the most important task at hand. “One of our favorite adages was ‘The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing,’ ” said Sullivan. “Which means what’s really important is to understand what the main thing really is, in a situation when there’s eighty-four symptoms and indicators flying around—what’s really the main thing here?

Successful risk-takers are adaptable. They are good generalists, taking advantage of new opportunities and responding to new threats.
In chapter 4, I reintroduced you to Bob Voulgaris, the Greek Canadian gambler whose sports-betting strategy centers around finding angles, exploitable opportunities that other bettors have overlooked. The problem with angles is that they usually don’t persist for very long; the market is just too efficient. So that’s why Voulgaris casts a wide net.

I call this personality type a fox, and that was also featured prominently in The Signal and the Noise. Fox is one of the two archetypes articulated in the Greek poet Archilochus’s saying: “The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.” Foxes rummage around for opportunities, wary of complacency and getting too tied down.
Now, this is one habit to which there are some exceptions. In particular, startup founders need to be laser focused on one big thing and be prepared to see it out for a decade or more. It still probably helps to have some fox-like cunning to pick the right big thing. But it isn’t strictly necessary if you stumble on the right idea.

Still, as the world gets more complicated, it’s generally the generalists who rule the roost.[*12] They are more likely to adapt successfully to the unknown. That’s what NASA is looking for in its astronauts, for instance—why Sullivan was chosen even though her background was in oceanography. “By and large, they’re looking for generalists,” she said. “Not a deep dive down one narrow little tube of academia or something like that. The ability to recognize or anticipate connections or think a bit laterally—that’s very important.”

Successful risk-takers are good estimators. They are Bayesians, comfortable quantifying their intuitions and working with incomplete information.
In poker, players can estimate probabilities with incredible precision. Tom

You also have to recognize that—as an outgrowth of Bayes’ theorem, which works by revising your probabilistic beliefs as you collect more information—your estimates will become more precise as you collect more data. But sometimes your edge comes from being willing to act on a relatively crude estimate to take advantage of an opportunity when other people are still mired in the fact-finding stage. “I’m always assessing risk versus reward in everything that I do. I’m always going to weigh out the pros and cons of any situation,” said Maria Ho. “Whereas somebody [else] might need ninety percent good reasons to do something,…if it’s fifty-five/forty-five good reasons, then I would be happy to take the risk.”

Successful risk-takers try to stand out, not fit in. They have independence of mind and purpose.

These people also do like competition, obviously—see item number two. But they don’t want to jump through the hoops that the rest of society does. And really, that’s a defining trait of most risk-takers. Yes, if you have a quantitative mindset but no urge to rebel against society, investment banking beckons for you. Silicon Valley prizes nonconformity, though, even if it’s a monoculture in its own ways.

contrarian. They have theories about why and when the conventional wisdom is wrong.
There is an oft-neglected distinction between independence and contrarianism. If I pick vanilla and you pick chocolate because you like chocolate better, you’re being independent. If you pick chocolate because I picked vanilla, you’re being contrarian. Most people are pretty damned conformist—humans are social animals—and Riverians are sometimes accused of being contrarian when they’re just being independent. If I do the conventional thing 99 percent of the time and you do it 85 percent of the time, you’ll seem rebellious by comparison, but you’re still mostly going with the flow.
But there are some parts of the River that have an explicit mandate to be contrarian. Sports betting is one example; if you just follow the public money, you’ll lose the same 5 percent juice to the house that everyone else loses.[*14] Hedge funds are another example; they charge investors exorbitant fees on the premise of achieving excess returns above and beyond what any ol’ Ernie Index Fund could get in the S&P 500.
“The thing about hedge funds, it’s the only industry in the world where not only do you have to be right, but everybody else also has to be wrong,” said Galen Hall, who earned more than $4 million from poker tournaments between 2011 and 2015 but nevertheless left to work for Bridgewater Associates

“Every single thing we do, I can point to, like, ‘here is the person who was doing a thing wrong,’ ” said Hall. “We build a map of all of the players in the world…who are trading for reasons other than they want to generate some alpha.[*15] You know, somebody got added to the S&P 500. So now all the S&P 500 ETFs out there have to buy this company. Or it’s a CEO of a startup, he’s now a billionaire. He has ninety-nine percent of his net worth in the company. He’s allowed to sell his shares on this day [and] he’s probably going to sell a bunch.”

Successful risk-takers are not driven by money. They live on the edge because it’s their way of life.
One ironic thing I’ve learned from my time in the River is that people who gamble for a living often aren’t motivated by money—and the best gamblers tend to be even less money driven. Now, they’re not ascetics; this isn’t meant to imply they don’t enjoy the fruits of their labors.
But poker players are distinct for two reasons. First, they’re so fiercely competitive that money mostly serves as a way to keep score.

The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.
—George Bernard Shaw

something about risk—something that most people in society don’t. It understands that a relatively remote chance is worth taking if it has a sufficiently high payoff. Indeed, some of the venture capitalists I spoke with for this chapter sounded a lot like poker players. “I always say expected value is the probability of success times the degree of impact. That math works easily, but people are very uncomfortable in the low-probability domains,” said Vinod Khosla

But on the “personality cluster”—competitiveness, risk tolerance, independent-mindedness often to the point of contrarianism—Silicon Valley is off the charts, even compared to Wall Street. And it is quite proud of this. “We believe in embracing variance, in increasing interestingness,” wrote Marc Andreessen, the Netscape cofounder turned VC whose egg-shaped head is synonymous in the Valley with hard-boiled, stubborn resolve, in his October 2023 “Techno-Optimist Manifesto.” “We believe in risk,” he wrote, italicizing the word “risk,” “in leaps into the unknown.”

Instead, I agree with Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who wrote in response to Andreessen that “AI is fundamentally different from other tech, and it is worth being uniquely careful.” AI is not the first technology that has the potential to destroy civilization, but unlike nuclear weapons, which were designed by governments, AI is being developed by Silicon Valley with its paradigm of “move fast and break things.”

There was [once] some place where statistical knowledge gave us an insight vis-à-vis the people who didn’t have access to it,” he said, mentioning innovations like the development of life insurance and the Black-Scholes model for pricing stock options. “But in the world of 2016, or 2022, if we are too focused on statistical or mathematical knowledge, we end up missing out on a lot.”

Smart, restless young men and women have always sought out action, and the smarter and more restless they are, the more they know how to sniff out the best stuff. With AI, the scent is fresh—a virtual frontier at a time when there are fewer and fewer physical ones left unexplored. Like the physicists at Los Alamos—some of whom played poker on the evening before Trinity—they are drawn to AI by the existentially high stakes even if they sometimes have trouble reconciling them with their human frailties.

Foxes like me, who try to be well calibrated between optimism and pessimism, would say this reflects something else: survivorship bias. If there’s a 1 percent chance of a nuclear war every year, you’ll look smart 99 times in a row by betting against it—until one day there’s an ICBM pointed at Honolulu and this time it isn’t a drill. But founders are hedgehogs, and Silicon Valley’s contrarianism accelerates this tendency. It sees the Village as a bunch of neurotic scolds—“people who want to be pessimistic because it makes them cool,” Altman said—and instinctually rebels against it.
