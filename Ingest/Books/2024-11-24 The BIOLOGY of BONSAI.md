## Highlights
Remember, almost all that wood is nonliving. Only the outermost layers, just under the bark, are living. The living outer layers are called, from the outside toward the inside; phloem, cambium and xylem. ([Location 151](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B08KS2BD59&location=151))

The amount of auxin produced is inversely proportional to how much light the terminal bud is receiving. What this means is, the more light there is, the less auxin is produced. Sunlight inhibits auxin production. This is very important! This makes sense. If there is already a lot of light, the plant does not have to put its energy into growing towards the light. It’s already there! Instead, it will use its resources to make more leaves to capture that light and make more food.
