## Highlights
What we have learned so far is that using AI well is a skill that needs to be carefully learned by… using it a lot. It’s just too unlike everything else. The call to tinker with it was the right one, but it was too much of a suggestion. This is what I want to change here today. We also learned that, as opposed to most tools, AI acts as a multiplier. We are all lucky to work with some amazing colleagues, the kind who contribute 10X of what was previously thought possible. It’s my favorite thing about this company. And what’s even more amazing is that, for the first time, we see the tools become 10X themselves. I’ve seen many of these people approach implausible tasks, ones we wouldn’t even have chosen to tackle before, with reflexive and brilliant usage of AI to get 100X the work done.

This represents both an opportunity and a requirement, deeply connected to our core values of *Be a Constant Learner<*/em> and Thrive* on Change. These aren't just aspirational phrases—they're fundamental expectations that come with being a part of this world-class team. This is what we founders wanted, and this is what we built.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jre0kmwv0j7nxdpnfragr5ey))

**Using AI effectively is now a fundamental expectation of everyone at Shopify.** It's a tool of all trades today, and will only grow in importance. Frankly, I don't think it's feasible to opt out of learning the skill of applying AI in your craft; you are welcome to try, but I want to be honest I cannot see this working out today, and definitely not tomorrow. Stagnation is almost certain, and stagnation is slow-motion failure. If you're not climbing, you're sliding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jre0n2b1wkr264w6n6vtv44e))

**We will add AI usage questions to our performance and peer review questionnaire**. Learning to use AI well is an unobvious skill. My sense is that a lot of people give up after writing a prompt and not getting the ideal thing back immediately. Learning to prompt and load context is important, and getting peers to provide feedback on how this is going will be valuable.

**Learning is self directed, but share what you learned**. You have access to as much of the cutting edge AI tools as possible.There is [chat.shopify.io](http://chat.shopify.io/), which we had for [years](https://proxy.shopify.ai/) now. Developers have proxy, Copilot, Cursor, Claude code, all pre-tooled and ready to go. We’ll learn and adapt together as a team. We’ll be sharing Ws (and Ls!) with each other as we experiment with new AI capabilities, and we’ll dedicate time to AI integration in our monthly business reviews and product development cycles. Slack and Vault have lots of places where people share prompts that they developed, like #revenue-ai-use-cases and #ai-centaurs.

**Before asking for more Headcount and resources**, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI. What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team? This question can lead to really fun discussions and projects.
