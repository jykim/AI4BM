## Summary
Willem Van Lancker has always learned the hard way. He thinks that’s exactly how it should be.

## Highlights
Years later, reflecting on the adventure, Van Lancker recognizes that sailing is as much about preparation as it is about the act itself. What you choose to do, or not do, at that stage is viscerally felt once you’re out on the water. Understanding how all the components go together goes far beyond being a necessary chore; it is essential to making it work at all.
That lesson now drives his contrarian take on AI: As it erodes friction from our lives, we risk losing the struggles that build judgment, expertise, and personal taste. According to Van Lancker, a partner at early-stage investment firm [Terrain](https://www.terrain.com/), a lifelong designer who has worked at Google and Apple, and shepherded several dozen startups from day zero, we need to [intentionally preserve friction in our work](https://every.to/thesis/in-the-ai-age-making-things-difficult-is-deliberate). We caught up with him to hear about how he’s doing this for himself.

Growing up in a house “humming with projects” from an “in-progress car rebuild in the garage” to “printed pillows drying across clotheslines in the yard,” Van Lancker learned by making. “My parents didn’t teach through abstract theories or carefully reasoned arguments; instead, they invited me to join their process and figure it out with them,” he says.
This “hands-on ethos” of learning shaped Van Lancker’s approach well beyond physical crafts, extending to writing, entrepreneurship, and design. “It built into me an appreciation for practice or project-based learning,” he explains, “and an understanding that mastery comes through the slow accumulation of experiments and errors.” In practice, this looks like building scrappy prototypes, iterating quickly, and treating every wrong turn as “necessary friction that deepens expertise.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6ychbeckrndfxgj9qkkytdq))
