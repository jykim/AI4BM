## Summary
AI experts Thomas H. Davenport and Randy Bean explain the top AI trends leaders should watch in the new year.

## Highlights
The earliest agents will be those for small, structured internal tasks with little money involved — for instance, helping change your password on the IT side, or reserving time off for vacations in HR systems. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtkttwa83f1htfh5hdtjnt2q))

One of the reasons why everybody is excited about agents is that as of 2024, it has still proved difficult to demonstrate economic value from generative AI. We argued in [last year’s AI trends article](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/five-key-trends-in-ai-and-data-science-for-2024/) that the value of GenAI still needed to be demonstrated.

Only a few academic studies have measured GenAI productivity gains, and when they have, they’ve generally found some improvements, but not exponential ones. Goldman Sachs is one of the rare companies that has [measured productivity gains in the area of programming](https://aiexpert.network/goldman-sachs-ai/). Developers there reported that their productivity increased by about 20%. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtktyvbd234ft82e8fsdeqta))

In many cases, the best way to measure productivity gains will be to establish controlled experiments. For example, a company could have one group of marketers use generative AI to create content without human review, one use it with human review, and a control group not use it at all. Again, few companies are doing this, and this will need to change. Given that GenAI is primarily about content generation for many companies right now, if we want to really understand the benefits, we’ll also have to start measuring content quality.

Generative AI has had another impact on organizations: It’s making unstructured data important again. In the 2025 AI & Data Leadership Executive Benchmark Survey, 94% of data and AI leaders said that interest in AI is leading to a greater focus on data. Since traditional analytical AI has been around for several decades, we think they were referring to GenAI’s impact. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtkv2ht2frdtf9y0hhj7eke3))

The great majority of the data that GenAI works with is relatively unstructured, in forms such as text, images, video, and the like. A leader at one large insurance organization recently shared with Randy that 97% of the company’s data was unstructured. Many companies are interested in using GenAI to help manage and provide access to their own data and documents, typically using an approach called retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG.
