## Summary
Bootstrapping is one of the simplest, yet most powerful methods in all of statistics. It provides us an easy way to get a sense of what might happen if we could repeat an experiment a bunch of times. It turns point estimates into distributions that can be used to calculate all kinds of stuff, including standard errors, confidence intervals and even p-values. In this video, we show how it can be used to calculate standard errors and confidence intervals. In Part 2, we'll see how to calculate p-values.

0:00 Awesome song and introduction
2:18 Bootstrapping in action!
4:23 Bootstrapping defined
6:40 Calculating standard errors and confidence intervals with bootstrapping
8:13 What makes bootstrapping so awesome

Correction: 
5:55 8^8 combinations of observed values and possible means assumes that order matters, and it doesn't. So 8^8 over counts the total number of useful combinations and the true number is 15 choose 8, which is 6435

## Highlights
so regardless of the statistic we calculate bootstrapping allows us to see it in the context of a distribution and we can use that distribution to help us interpret the initial results ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jghsyj5bfkgpmhxwfczfejbx))
