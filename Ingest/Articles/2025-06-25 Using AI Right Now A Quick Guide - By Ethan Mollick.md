## Summary
Which AIs to use, and how to use them

## Highlights
• Second opinions in law, medicine, and other fields (it should go without saying that you should trust your doctor/lawyer above AI, but research keeps finding that the more advanced AI systems do [very well in diagnosis](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.07.25329176v1) with a [surprisingly low hallucination rate](https://x.com/emollick/status/1899562684405670394), so they can be useful for second opinions).
