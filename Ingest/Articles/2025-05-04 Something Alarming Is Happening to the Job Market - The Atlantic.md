## Summary
A new sign that AI is competing with college grads

## Highlights
second theory points to a deeper, more structural shift: College doesn’t confer the same labor advantages that it did 15 years ago. According to research by the San Francisco Federal Reserve, 2010 [marked](https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp2025-01.pdf) a turning point, when the lifetime-earnings gap between college grads and high-school graduates stopped widening. At the same time, the share of online job postings seeking workers with a college degree has [declined](https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/wp2025-01.pdf).

The third theory is that the relatively weak labor market for college grads could be an early sign that artificial intelligence is starting to transform the economy.
“When you think from first principles about what generative AI can do, and what jobs it can replace, it’s the kind of things that young college grads have done” in white-collar firms, Deming told me. “They read and synthesize information and data. They produce reports and presentations.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtd329qpc7ghy46e91d3sj4y))

Consider, then, a novel economic indicator: the recent-grad gap. It’s the difference between the unemployment of young college graduates and the overall labor force. Going back four decades, young college graduates almost always have a lower—sometimes much lower—unemployment rate than the overall economy, because they are relatively cheap labor and have just spent four years marinating in a (theoretically) enriching environment.
But last month’s recent-grad gap hit an all-time low. That is, today’s college graduates are entering an economy that is relatively worse for young college grads than any month on record, going back at least four decades. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jtd33a60xsfyq37c0qsz8hkk))

The strong interpretation of this graph is that it’s exactly what one would expect to see if firms replaced young workers with machines. As law firms leaned on AI for more paralegal work, and consulting firms realized that five 22-year-olds with ChatGPT could do the work of 20 recent grads, and tech firms turned over their software programming to a handful of superstars working with AI co-pilots, the entry level of America’s white-collar economy would contract.
