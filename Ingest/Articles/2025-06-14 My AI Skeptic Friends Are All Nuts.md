## Summary
My smartest friends have bananas arguments about LLM coding.

## Highlights
If you’re making requests on a ChatGPT page and then pasting the resulting (broken) code into your editor, you’re not doing what the AI boosters are doing. No wonder you’re talking past each other. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxqwzhvc17nq2psp94gtefa7))

LLMs can write a large fraction of all the tedious code you’ll ever need to write. And most code on most projects is tedious. LLMs drastically reduce the number of things you’ll ever need to Google. They look things up themselves. Most importantly, they don’t get tired; they’re immune to inertia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxqx26z4cgn9zx844vcm4bn5))

I can feel my blood pressure rising thinking of all the bookkeeping and Googling and dependency drama of a new project. An LLM can be instructed to just figure all that shit out. Often, it will drop you precisely at that golden moment where shit almost works, and development means tweaking code and immediately seeing things work better. That dopamine hit is why I code.

Does an intern cost $20/month? Because that’s what Cursor.ai costs.
Part of being a senior developer is making less-able coders productive, be they fleshly or algebraic. Using agents well is both a both a skill and an engineering project all its own, of prompts, indices, [and (especially) tooling.](https://fly.io/blog/semgrep-but-for-real-now/) LLMs only produce shitty code if you let them.

Developers all love to preen about code. They worry LLMs lower the “ceiling” for quality. Maybe. But they also raise the “floor”.
Gemini’s floor is higher than my own. My code looks nice. But it’s not as thorough. LLM code is repetitive. But mine includes dumb contortions where I got too clever trying to DRY things up. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxr3xf8y4qx7ntccxhymd6fy))

If truly mediocre code is all we ever get from LLMs, that’s still huge. It’s that much less mediocre code humans have to write. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxr3yqvr3447yqg4jnymrstq))

LLMs easily — alarmingly — clear industry quality bars. Gallingly, one of the things they’re best at is churning out just-good-enough facsimiles of human creative work. I have family in visual arts. I can’t talk to them about LLMs. I don’t blame them. They’re probably not wrong. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxr42rxd5qahjvqr1b1y8wq0))

There’s plenty of things I can’t trust an LLM with. No LLM has any of access to prod here. But I’ve been first responder on an incident and fed 4o — not o4-mini, 4o — log transcripts, and watched it in seconds spot LVM metadata corruption issues on a host we’ve been complaining about for months. Am I better than an LLM agent at interrogating OpenSearch logs and Honeycomb traces? No. No, I am not. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jxr4837gqm72hgxxxyxn6ppm))
