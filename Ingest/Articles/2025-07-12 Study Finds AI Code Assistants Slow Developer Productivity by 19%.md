## Summary
According to a recent study by AI research nonprofit METR, experienced software developers using AI coding assistants like Cursor took 19% longer to complete...

## Highlights
Despite widespread claims about AI coding assistants boosting productivity, a significant perception-reality gap exists. While GitHub reports 88% of Copilot users feel more productive and some companies claim productivity increases of 10-20%, actual research paints a different picture.[1](https://cybernews.com/ai-news/ai-coding-assistants-productivity-quality-tradeoffs/) Only 6% of engineering leaders surveyed by LeadDev reported significant productivity boosts, with most (39%) seeing minor gains of just 1-10%.[1](https://cybernews.com/ai-news/ai-coding-assistants-productivity-quality-tradeoffs/) This disconnect is particularly striking in the METR study, where developers believed AI had sped them up by 20% even after experiencing a measurable 19% slowdown.[2](https://leaddev.com/velocity/ai-coding-assistants-arent-really-making-devs-feel-more-productive) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzzcky5vh6fjhzy9zwpeh5d9))

The gap between perceived and actual productivity may stem from cognitive factors. When developers invest significant mental effort in using AI tools—crafting prompts, interpreting outputs, and integrating suggestions—they may overestimate the tools' benefits.[3](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/)[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/1ftrc6l/ai_coding_assistants_do_not_boost_productivity_or/) This aligns with the "effort justification paradigm," which suggests that higher investment in obtaining solutions leads to inflated perceptions of their value.[4](https://www.reddit.com/r/technews/comments/1ftrc6l/ai_coding_assistants_do_not_boost_productivity_or/) Additionally, AI assistants excel at making code more understandable (the top reported use case) rather than simply producing it faster, creating a feeling of productivity that may not translate to measurable time savings.[5](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.02684v1)[6](https://arxiv.org/html/2412.06603v2) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzzcmbhffa367gt4ywgez8c7))
