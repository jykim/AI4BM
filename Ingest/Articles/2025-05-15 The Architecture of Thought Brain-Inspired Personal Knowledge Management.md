## Highlights
The concept of a "second brain" is fundamentally aimed at alleviating the storage burden on biological WM. By externalizing information, the PKM system allows an individual's finite WM capacity to be dedicated to active processing, analysis, and synthesis, rather than mere retention. Awareness of WM limitations informs the need for PKM and guides strategies for structuring information within it—such as breaking down complex topics into smaller, more digestible "atomic" notes—to facilitate easier cognitive processing.

Short-term memory is closely related to WM but is often distinguished by its more passive role in temporarily holding information, typically for about 15 to 30 seconds, before it is either forgotten or transferred to long-term memory. Many everyday thoughts, observations, or pieces of information might only reside in STM. The transient nature of STM underscores the importance of rapid capture mechanisms in PKM. Ideas or insights that are not quickly externalized into a note-taking system or other capture tool are highly susceptible to being lost as new information displaces them from STM.

• • *Episodic Memory:* This system stores memories of personal events, experiences, and their contexts (e.g., what happened at a specific meeting, a personal anecdote). The **hippocampus** is critically involved in the formation and initial consolidation of episodic memories.  
• *Semantic Memory:* This system stores general knowledge about the world, including facts, concepts, and vocabulary, independent of the specific learning context (e.g., the definition of "synaptic plasticity," the capital of France). Semantic memories are thought to be primarily stored in distributed networks across the **neocortex** , with the **prefrontal cortex** playing a role in their retrieval.
