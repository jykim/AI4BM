## Summary
Anthropic is an AI safety and research company that's working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems.

## Highlights
Our experience suggests that it is necessary to make many tricky judgment calls and considerations when running such a (supposedly) simple and standardized evaluation. The challenges we encountered with MMLU often apply to other similar multiple-choice evaluations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgz3fw1vzfv64dtdga623vat))

To measure these harms in our own model (Claude), we use the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ), an evaluation that tests for social biases against people belonging to protected classes along nine social dimensions. We were convinced that BBQ provides a good measurement of social biases only after implementing and comparing BBQ against several similar evaluations. This effort took us months.

1. There is an inherent tension between helpfulness and harmlessness. A system could avoid harm simply by providing unhelpful responses like “sorry, I can’t help you with that”. What is the right balance between helpfulness and harmlessness? What numerical value indicates a model is sufficiently helpful and harmless? What high-level norms or values should we test for above and beyond helpfulness and harmlessness? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgz3brnez6y4y73m7bqggf58))

• Red teaming AI systems is presently more art than science; red teamers attempt to elicit concerning behaviors by probing models, but this process is not yet standardized. A robust and repeatable process is critical to ensure that red teaming accurately reflects model capabilities and establishes a shared baseline on which different models can be meaningfully compared.
