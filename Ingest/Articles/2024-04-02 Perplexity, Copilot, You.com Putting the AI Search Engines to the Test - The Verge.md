## Summary
The text discusses the evolving landscape of AI search engines and their capabilities compared to Google. It highlights that while AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot are improving, they still struggle with certain types of queries, such as navigational queries where Google excels in speed and accuracy. The text also explores information queries and exploration queries, where AI tools show potential but may not match Google's speed and efficiency. Overall, the text emphasizes the complexity of search engines and questions whether AI can fully replace Google's dominance in the search business in terms of functionality and user experience.

## Highlights
There is one sub-genre of information queries in which the exact opposite is true, though. I call them Buried Information Queries. The best example I can offer is the very popular query, “how to screenshot on mac.” There are a million pages on the internet that contain the answer — it’s just Cmd-Shift-3 to take the whole screen or Cmd-Shift-4 to capture a selection, there, you’re welcome — but that information is usually buried under a lot of ads and SEO crap. All the AI tools I tried, including Google’s own Search Generative Experience, just snatch that information out and give it to you directly. This is great!
