I have a view that differs from this. In other words, I think that learning the statistical regularities is a far bigger deal than meets the eye. Prediction is also a statistical phenomenon. Yet to predict you need to understand the underlying process that produced the data. You need to understand more and more about the world that produced the data. As our generative models become extraordinarily good, they will have, I claim, a shocking degree of understanding of the world and many of its subtleties.

Now on the point of hallucinations, it has a propensity of making stuff up from time to time, and that's something that also greatly limits their usefulness. But I'm quite hopeful that by simply improving this subsequent reinforcement learning from human feedback step, we can teach it to not hallucinate. Now you could say is it really going to learn? My answer is, let's find out.
