## Summary
Who Digs the Deepest: Google, OpenAI, DeepSeek, or You.com?

## Highlights
Sebastian Raschka [explains why AI models](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2025/understanding-reasoning-llms.html) can still produce **mediocre or nonsensical answers**, especially when faced with **ambiguous or flawed questions.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkh9g6b2hd92nx0he39je92y))

Raschka notes that better prompting improves AI performance. **None of the tested AIs asked for clarification** on vague terms like “lowest EV share” or “market expectations” in North Korea. Instead, they **guessed and fabricated details.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jkh9fwwts9f7n78rs9pm5m27))

My tests confirm Raschka’s findings: **AI isn’t necessarily good at reasoning, especially when you don’t train them.** Without **proper training, verification, and the ability to reject bad premises,** these models **produce polished but incorrect answers.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsw2chw7m4qc6dsg9rdzdzf))

1️⃣ **Start with a Meta Question:** Instead of diving straight into a specific query, I first ask, **"What are the best questions I can ask about this topic?"** This helps the AI define a solid research framework before generating any conclusions.

2️⃣ **Clarify the Subject:** I then ask the AI to generate **a list of thought-provoking questions** related to the topic. This step helps me refine my focus and identify gaps in my own understanding before proceeding. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsw7agnqrdhb14r7twne4rn))

3️⃣ **Challenge the AI with My Own Data:** Once I receive initial answers, I critically analyze them. **Anything that seems vague, misleading, or outright wrong gets confronted with my own sources and data.** This forces the AI to adjust its reasoning based on real-world evidence rather than defaulting to confident but incorrect assumptions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsw7g2fc2347abz3h43jq82))

4️⃣ **Verify Sources and Double-Check Claims:** Now comes the accountability test. I ask, **"Can you verify each claim with a reliable source?"** This ensures that the AI isn’t just generating plausible-sounding responses but is backing them up with verifiable data. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsw7q68ztyfg7kkndk763d9))

5️⃣ **Optimize the Process for the Future:** Once I’m satisfied with the results, I end by asking, **"What should I have asked from the start to get to this level of accuracy faster?"** This final step refines my prompting strategy, helping me shorten the training process next time.
