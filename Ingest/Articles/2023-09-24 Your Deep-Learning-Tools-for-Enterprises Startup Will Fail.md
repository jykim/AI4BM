## Highlights
You may want to train a neural network for machine perception tasks like detecting merchandise in images, but use gradient boosted trees for fraud detection, or linear regression for click prediction.

The reasons for my conviction can be boiled down to three main arguments: 1) Not everything is deep learning, 2) Given that enterprises have broader needs, they can’t deal with specialized and narrow tools, and 3) Monetizing developer tools is hard.

Don’t provide developer tools, provide solutions. As described in “Position in the stack and users”, most of the business value is created in higher level solutions, and those are less prone to the common pitfalls outlined above.

Every assumption you make about the technology stack below your tool limits the addressable market.
