## Summary
I used to think I wasn't creative. Once I discovered that creativity is a system, I realized I could optimize the process and make the act of creating easy and effortless.

In this video, I walk through my complete creative process and introduce you to the creative framework I use for developing my ideas.

## Highlights
The first law of flywheels states that in a flywheel, activities must flow smoothly from one stage into the next. And this is not only important when creating but for everything related to personal knowledge management, or PKM. It's a fundamental
principle for any PKM stack as information needs to flow freely into and then out of your PKM system in order for you to get the most out of your notes and ideas. The second law of flywheels states that each rotation is easier than the previous rotation. And this is an important point because the hardest part about a flywheel is getting It started. But once you get it going, it becomes easier and easier to keep it going. The place where many people break this law is by failing to have an output by creating something new from the component pieces that they've collected.
That's the last step in the creativity flywheel framework that we'll get to in a moment. But if you just keep consuming, there isn't any output and the flywheel doesn't turn. If you start creating though, even if it's not published somewhere publicly, it feeds back into the first step of the creativity flywheel and it makes it easier to keep that flywheel spinning.
Now, that pairs nicely with the third law of flywheels, which is that each rotation produces more than the previous rotation. It can be difficult to see, especially at the beginning, but if you keep creating consistently and keep that flywheel spinning, the compound effect kicks in before long, and it makes the act of creating much easier. The more you work with your notes and ideas inside of your PKM system using the creativity flywheel framework that we'll get to in a moment, the more value you get from those notes and ideas.

We actually do not want an effortless way to send things from our capture bucket straight into Obsidian. By adding some time and an additional step, we ensure that only the best stuff makes the cut. In fact, I estimate that I only bring over about 10% of the things that I capture. The other 90% I discard, and I trust that if those things are really important, then they're going to come back to me. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvah8x8cvdn7kd7b015b34yc))

Think of your PKM system as a greenhouse for your ideas. Once you plant them, you need to let them mature before you start to see some fruit from them. And one of the worst things you can do for an idea is to try to make something out of it before it's had time to ripen. When you've got a system for developing your ideas, then you don't feel the pressure to force an An idea before it's ready. You know you'll have more ideas to choose from because that flywheel continues to turn. The inbox folder in Obsidian is my idea greenhouse, and that's where things go when I send them to Obsidian, and I keep them there until they're ready to be worked on. I may add to these notes here or there, but most of the time, these are blank notes that are just sitting in that folder until I need them.

In his classic book, "How to Read a Book," Mortimer Adler talks about The four levels of reading. The first level is elementary reading, and this is where you consider what this specific sentence says. The second level is inspectional reading, where you start to consider what this book is about. The third level is analytical reading, where you ask many organized questions in order to grow the author's arguments and decide what you are going to do with them. And the fourth level is synoptical reading, where you consider the author's arguments in the context of the other books that you've read. Now, this is the key because no one book contains the total answer for what you are looking for. I believe that ideas and notes gain exponentially more value when they are connected and given a broader context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvahc481d62bxk9tvqgbq9z5))
