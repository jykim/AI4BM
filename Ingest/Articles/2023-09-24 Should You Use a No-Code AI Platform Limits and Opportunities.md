## Highlights
Despite what most people might think, the difficulty of building Machine Learning models is not the coding, but the data at your disposal, feature engineering, architecture and testing. In some no-code solutions, you lack the ability to fine tune and tweek the different parameters.

As mentioned before, no-code AI tools can be positive but they require specific governance. Indeed, if you don’t integrate them in a governed and controlled way, you’re just introducing more shadow IT and more issues.

My other concern with the development of no-code AI tools is related to dependency. Indeed, your solution might not require a data scientist but probably some consultants in the future to help you better understand ML or make your solution scalable. As such, the dependence on technically proficient experts will not disappear.
