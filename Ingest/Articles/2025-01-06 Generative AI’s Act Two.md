## Summary
One year ago, we published a hypothesis that generative AI would become a profound platform shift in technology. Then came the firestorm.

## Highlights
We now believe the market is entering “Act 2”—which will be from the *customer-back*. Act 2 will solve human problems end-to-end. These applications are different in nature than the first apps out of the gate. They tend to use foundation models as a piece of a more comprehensive solution rather than the entire solution. They introduce new editing interfaces, making the workflows stickier and the outputs better. They are often multi-modal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgyqb2zywq180pvjbgc488zy))

But a quick listen to Eleven Labs’ voices on TikTok or Runway’s AI film festival makes it clear that the future has arrived at warp speed. Even 3D models, gaming and music are becoming good, *quickly*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgyrkc90bxqhxy9bxzwk5wxn))

**Vertical separation hasn’t happened yet**. We still believe that there will be a separation between the “application layer” companies and foundation model providers, with model companies specializing in scale and research and application layer companies specializing in product and UI.

The swiftness of the incumbent response, from Google’s Duet and Bard to Adobe’s Firefly—and the willingness of incumbents to finally go “risk on”—has magnified the competitive heat. Even in the foundation model layer, we are seeing customers set up their infrastructure to be agnostic between different vendors.

**The moats are in the customers, not the data.** We predicted that the best generative AI companies could generate a sustainable competitive advantage through a data flywheel: more usage → more data → better model → more usage. While this is still somewhat true, especially in domains with very specialized and hard-to-get data, the “data moats” are on shaky ground: the data that application companies generate does not create an insurmountable moat, and the next generations of foundation models may very well obliterate any data moats that startups generate. Rather, *workflows* and *user networks* seem to be creating more durable sources of competitive advantage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgyrqb9s3mhjbhpqgy4j0v6s))

But ChatGPT is not an isolated phenomenon. The depth of engagement of Character AI (2 hour average session time), the productivity benefits of Github Copilot (55% more efficient), and the monetization path of Midjourney (hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue) all suggest that the first cohort of killer apps has arrived.

But do people stick around? Not really. The below chart compares the month 1 mobile app retention of AI-first applications to existing companies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgyrv52tfqfnaetd4xphmyk8))

By contrast, generative AI apps have a median of 14% (with the notable exception of Character and the “AI companionship” category). This means that users are not finding enough value in Generative AI products to use them every day yet. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgyrw9emjzdytzkf3v1kq8ey))

What are you going to use all this infrastructure to do? How is it going to change people’s lives?” The path to building enduring businesses will require fixing the retention problem and generating deep enough value for customers that they stick and become daily active users.

However, Amara’s Law—the phenomenon that we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run—is running its course. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgys37pja8qfnr8p4fa2bqz7))
