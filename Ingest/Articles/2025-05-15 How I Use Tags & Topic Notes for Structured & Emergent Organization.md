## Summary
Tags can operate an alternative to folders because Obsidian has the option to filter by tag in a similar manner to a traditional folder, though I personally use both tags & folders.

## Highlights
How I Use Tags
I have three main uses of Tags:
1. indicating the note type
2. indicating the status of a note
3. indicating that a note contains a sub-note type (in-line tag) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jv9c3v74njvjxse1f6wvanhm))

How I Use Topic Notes
While it is possible to use tags to indicate topics (e.g., # neuroscience), tags help more with searching and are somewhat rigid. Neuroscience itself has many sub-topics, so how could I indicate which level of neuroscience a note was dealing with? There is no way to "contain" information within a tag, it is effectively a folder.
[Topic Notes](https://wanderloots.xyz/404) on the other hand are *far* more flexible than tags. By using an actual note as a topic, I can use the topic for search, but I can also use the note to indicate connection to other notes via [Bi-Directional Links](https://wanderloots.xyz/digital-garden/published/bi-directional-links/).
