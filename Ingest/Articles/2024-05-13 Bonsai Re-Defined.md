## Summary
The author shares a new philosophy called Focal Point Bonsai Design, focusing on creating visual impact by shaping branches around key features. Traditional bonsai design approaches are compared, emphasizing the importance of sculpting deadwood and branches to enhance tree aesthetics. The principles of Bonsai creation include incorporating crooked branches and refining deadwood to add value to the tree's appearance.

## Highlights
Focal Point Bonsai means shaping the foliage and branches to surround and frame the area of greatest visual value.

All man-made pruning scars are inappropriate and ugly; no dreaded bulls eyes, please.3. All trees deserve crooked, gnarly, undulating branches.4. Wire training is essential to bonsai control and design. Try not to encumber a tree with needless wire, use guys and pulls when possible in lieu of heavy wire.
