## Summary
The creators of a new test called “Humanity’s Last Exam” argue we may soon lose the ability to create tests hard enough for A.I. models.

## Highlights
Mr. Hendrycks worked with Scale AI, an A.I. company where he is an advisor, to compile the test, which consists of roughly 3,000 multiple-choice and short answer questions designed to test A.I. systems’ abilities in areas ranging from analytic philosophy to rocket engineering.

Kevin Zhou, a postdoctoral researcher in theoretical particle physics at the University of California, Berkeley, submitted a handful of questions to the test. Three of his questions were chosen, all of which he told me were “along the upper range of what one might see in a graduate exam.”

“You can imagine a better version of this where we can give questions that we don’t know the answers to yet, and we’re able to verify if the model is able to help solve it for us,” said Summer Yue, Scale AI’s director of research and an organizer of the exam.

But I also believe that we need more creative methods of tracking A.I. progress that don’t rely on standardized tests, because most of what humans do — and what we fear A.I. will do better than us — can’t be captured on a written exam.

“There’s a big gulf between what it means to take an exam and what it means to be a practicing physicist and researcher,” he said. “Even an A.I. that can answer these questions might not be ready to help in research, which is inherently less structured.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jm5egdxz0g7q0h69rhq8d10g))
