## Summary
In the near future, artificial intelligence (AI) agents will revolutionize how people interact with computers and upend the software industry. These agents, which respond to natural language and have a deep understanding of the user, will replace the need for different apps for different tasks. They will be able to help with a wide range of activities and areas of life, including healthcare, education, productivity, and entertainment. Agents will democratize services that were previously too expensive for most people, such as mental health care and supplemental instruction. They will also serve as a new platform for creating apps and services, eliminating the need for coding or graphic design skills. However, there are still technical challenges and questions about privacy and security that need to be addressed before the full potential of AI agents can be realized.

## Highlights
Why will people use agents?
The answer is that they’ll be dramatically better. You’ll be able to have nuanced conversations with them. They will be much more personalized, and they won’t be limited to relatively simple tasks like writing a letter. Clippy has as much in common with agents as a rotary phone has with a mobile device.
