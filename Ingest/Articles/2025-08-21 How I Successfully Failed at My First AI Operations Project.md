## Summary
Sometimes the best AI solution is the one you don't build yourself

## Highlights
When I started in the [AI operations role](https://every.to/working-overtime/ai-doesn-t-care-about-your-resume) at Every this past June, I knew right away what I wanted to build first: an AI‑powered editor. One of our guiding principles for automation at Every is ["](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-mantra-of-this-ai-age-don-t-repeat-yourself)[Don't repeat yourself](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-mantra-of-this-ai-age-don-t-repeat-yourself)[."](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/the-mantra-of-this-ai-age-don-t-repeat-yourself) If you notice yourself making the same edits over and over, that's your cue to call in AI for help.
And there are plenty of edits we make again and again. Where's the lead? Is it at the top where it belongs, or buried in paragraph five? Do the headline, subheading, and introduction work together to draw readers in? Are the stakes clear? Is the writer's credibility established? These aren't small notes—they're the core of how Every thinks about good writing. Because they repeat across every draft, they're exactly the kind of work an AI assistant can excel at: Surface patterns, enforce standards, and leave the final creative judgment to humans.

The goal is to cut down on the revision cycles our writers and editors go through to get a piece publication-ready. Every publishes daily with a small team. Many of the team members who write have jobs that are *not* writing, and many of them aren’t professional writers, so editing cycles are easily our biggest bottleneck. Writers average 3-4 revision rounds per piece, with each round taking 2-3 days—meaning a single essay often takes two weeks from draft to publication.
I'd built a system for my own pieces that worked beautifully. Each week, the Every editorial team talks through how the week’s pieces could have been stronger—buried leads, abstract language, missing stakes. I combined those patterns with Every's style guide, examples of our best-performing pieces, and a taxonomy of common issues we see in drafts. All of that went into a Claude project—a dedicated workspace where you can store documents, instructions, and context that carry over across every chat you initiate inside of it**.** ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k36qq1z01389aey2z0bfjac0))

There's an entire constellation of considerations in making AI useful in an organization that have very little to do with vibe coding jam sessions. There’s education—how do you inform the team about an available solution, and how to use it? There's reliability—it has to work every time, not just when you're there to debug it. And there's change management—convincing writers to paste their precious drafts into yet another tool when they're already juggling five different platforms.

It doesn’t matter if *I* find my creations useful. What matters is whether other people can use it, want to use it, and get value from it when they do. That's a completely different bar—one that, as we’re about to see, was alternately tricky and incredibly simple to clear.
