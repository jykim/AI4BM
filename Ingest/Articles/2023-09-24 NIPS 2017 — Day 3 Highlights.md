## Highlights
In order to bridge that gap, researchers are exploring ways to generate more task specific RL algorithms. To accomplish this, Abbeel and others propose we rethink how we learn from an environment. In short, we create a model that looks at an environment or a task and then designs a custom RL algorithm that can more effectively learn from it.

Some of these techniques have started to be extended to tasks such as one-shot imitation learning, a holy grail of Artificial Intelligence, which would allow an AI to learn a task by simply seeing a human perform it once

In essence, RL is mainly concerned with learning an effective policy to have an agent interact with the world in a way that best achieves a goal.

This work aims to surmount two key challenges currently facing RL: 1) Existing model-free methods for deep RL require a lot of data and 2) they typically don’t generalize well. In contrast, model-based methods are expensive in high dimensional environments.

This information can be used to generate new videos in which an object remains coherent but its pose and location change over time.
