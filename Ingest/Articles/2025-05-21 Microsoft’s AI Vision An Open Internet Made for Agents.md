## Summary
On the ground at the Microsoft Build conference with CTO Kevin Scott

## Highlights
Think about it like this. As I’m [fond of saying](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/vibe-check-o3-is-out-and-it-s-great), frontier models are jet engines. They’re super powerful, but if you drop a jet engine on my doorstep I won’t be able to do much with it. Stick it on a plane and give me a pilot, though, and the equation changes.
As I’ve been writing since 2023, raw intelligence is only one half of the puzzle. Models are [only as good as the information](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/a-few-things-i-believe-about-ai) they have access to. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvr5khw3z77m73vy7ke0nmaq))

**Throwing its weight behind MCP.** MCP (model context protocol) is an open standard from Anthropic that allows LLMs to interact with other data sources, like X or Y. Microsoft is adopting MCP as a standard inside all of its platforms—including building MCP support into Windows—to make it easy to wire up an LLM into any part of the Microsoft ecosystem, and any application on your computer.

**Launching NLWeb to make your website chatbot-ready.** NLWeb takes your existing website and makes it easy to consume for chatbots by automatically creating structured data from your site that they can parse. It’s an old idea from the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web) reborn in the AI age, so your users can access the information on your website more easily inside of their AI experiences.

The company is building all of the above as a way to promote an open AI ecosystem rather than a vertically integrated one. Satya Nadella and Kevin Scott spent a lot of time extolling the virtues of an open system for agent interoperation that mirrors the web, rather than a walled garden owned by a single player. The bet is that this will foster lots of new startups that adopt its infrastructure and tools like Windows, AI Foundry, and Azure.

Copilot agent is designed to fix that—allowing you to build features and fix bugs with an agent you can communicate with right inside of Github, where you’re already doing a lot of your developer work. It’s [powered by Claude Sonnet 3.7](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/20/ai-agents-software-programming-coding) instead of an OpenAI model, which is particularly interesting given OpenAI’s [Codex launch](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/vibe-check-codex-openai-s-new-coding-agent) last week.
