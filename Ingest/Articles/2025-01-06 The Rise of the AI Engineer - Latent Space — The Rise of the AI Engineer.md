## Summary
Thanks for the many comments and questions on HN and Twitter! We convened a snap Twitter Space to talk it through and >1,000 AI Engineers tuned in. Playback here!

## Highlights
I am calling attention to this trend rather than starting it. There are 10x as many [ML Engineer jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=%22machine+learning+engineer%22&l=&vjk=92db5c6fe7c47a89) as [AI Engineer jobs](https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=%22ai+engineer%22&l=&vjk=9d645e42687689ae) on Indeed, but the higher growth rate of “AI” leads me to predict that this ratio will invert in 5 years.

**In the near future, nobody will recommend** ***[starting](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36432772)*** **[in AI Engineering by reading Attention is All You Need](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36432772),** just like you do not start driving by reading the schematics for the Ford Model T. Sure, understanding fundamentals and history is always helpful, and does help you find ideas and efficiency/capability gains that are not yet in common consciousness. But sometimes you can just *use* products and learn their qualities through experience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jgymgght9pr1p2qkehpfph8h))
