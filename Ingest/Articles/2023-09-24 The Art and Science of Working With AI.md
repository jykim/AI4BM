## Summary
OOur research on how to get the most out of AI indicates one overarching rule of thumb: the more detail you give in your prompts, the better the answer will be.

## Highlights
If you ask Microsoft 365 Chat a simple or open-ended question, it will answer in kind. But if you want more detail and refinement, the question must be more pointed. For instance, if you ask Copilot, *what did I miss yesterday?* it will offer up a slew of email and chat summaries that you were looped in on.

“With traditional search, people have become so accustomed to being very concise,” says Tara Roth, Corporate Vice President of Microsoft 365 Customer Success Engineering. “You use just a few key words and get a lot of links back, and then do a lot of processing on your own. With prompting, you can be more verbose and descriptive about what you want to get the most accurate and relevant responses.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb2d80excc5xxvzgbjh12vhm))

Try specifying tone (neutral, casual, professional) or giving guidance for what kind of language to use, i.e., *language a non-technical person could understand*. Analogies, poems, and even historical allegories (*what is a moment in history I can use to explain the central message in this doc?*) can be useful ways to help you process the information.

It’s also helpful to give Copilot a point of view from which to answer. Usually, that involves some explanation about who you are and what you’re trying to achieve so the AI can roleplay: *You are a social media manager writing LinkedIn copy. You are a product marketer working on a new campaign.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb2dab7sv041q039ffvgrrcj))

Another best practice: Ask Copilot to explain how it arrived at a response. “If you ask the model to explain itself, it will produce a better answer,” Teevan says. “It’s similar to how math teachers ask students to show their work—they get better answers from the kids.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb2d9nfgvnjc9y7t3b7qpyrb))

At one end of the spectrum, the researchers say, AI can function like a steroid, giving people a short-term superhuman boost—instantaneous email drafts! quick social media copy!—when they simply offload work to it. In the middle of the spectrum, AI is like a high-quality running sneaker: it can speed up routine, time-consuming tasks (think cleaning and reformatting data), freeing up time and making people more productive in the moment without any long-term consequences ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb2dcsan196dscap3h34zdc9))

Experimentation is key. Get creative with different prompts, feedback, and refinements until you find what works best for what you need. And be polite: Basic etiquette, such as saying please and thank you, [goes a long way](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/why-using-a-polite-tone-with-ai-matters). Generative AI is trained on human conversations, so when it registers politeness, it’s more likely to be polite back ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hb2dg7an7v69e6pf08r87yqz))
