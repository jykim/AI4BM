## Summary
A review of the current state of AI through the lens of the Big Five tech companies.

## Highlights
Bill Gates maxim that “We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfbypf7q8dr3z3t7ts4p07e))

What Microsoft did that Intel — another company I compared Apple to — did not, was respond to their mobile miss by accepting their loss, building a complementary business (cloud computing), which then positioned them for the AI paradigm. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfc0wys9mzbk808he5wyh5h))

On the other hand, integration can have downsides: Google’s dependence on its own TPUs means that the company is competing with the Nvidia ecosystem up-and-down the stack; this is good for direct cost savings, but could be incurring hidden costs in terms of tooling and access to innovations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfc6ndbdk57b477f69msc5x))

This speaks to what might be Google’s most important advantage: data. Veo can draw on YouTube video, the scale of which is hard to fathom. Google’s LLMs, meanwhile, benefit not only from Google’s leading position in terms of indexing the web, but also the fact that no website can afford to block Google’s crawler. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfc7bmtvgf6me2ndhtzegsp))

The problem with having a near perfect business model — which is what Google had with Search ads where users picked the winner of an auction — is that there is nowhere to go but down. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfc9mt59668pjqmetydmxfw))

There are risks, however. The scarce resource Meta competes for is attention, and LLMs are already consuming huge amounts of it and expanding all the time. There is an argument that this makes chatbots just as much of a problem for Meta as they are for Google: ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcdkhnvzhfjfzr1wpaqjj2))

the seeming speed and desperation with these AI recruiting efforts strongly suggests that the company’s core business is threatened in ways I didn’t properly appreciate or foresee two years ago. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcegw5h7axqhe4smn3xz2c))

What does concern me is the extent to which Meta seems to lack direction with AI; [that was my biggest takeaway](https://sharptech.fm/member/episode/meta-and-its-many-plans-in-ai-apple-gets-hammered-in-court-the-costs-of-waiting-to-do-the-right-thing) from [my last interview with Zuckerberg](https://stratechery.com/2025/an-interview-with-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-about-ai-and-the-evolution-of-social-media/). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcffg21a6gf5b7qjp59g17))

GitHub Copilot has been surpassed by startups like Cursor and dedicated offerings from foundation model makers, while the lack of usage and monetization numbers for Microsoft’s other Copilot products are perhaps telling in their absence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcktkv4a6vkstc6rf732bc))

• The extent that AI replaces knowledge workers is the extent to which the Microsoft 365 franchise, [like all subscription-as-a-service businesses](https://stratechery.com/2025/ais-uneven-arrival/), could be disrupted. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcm7ez7y46vgzaeb4y2h49))

Azure, meanwhile, is the exclusive non-OpenAI provider of OpenAI APIs, which not only keeps Microsoft enterprise customers on Azure, but is also a draw in their own right. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcnv963fwg52nkg2e24jah))

The other thing that Microsoft should do is deepen their relationship — and scale of investment — in alternative model providers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcptw7fsv0d9r10hj8yyss))

these sorts of investments are expensive, but not having access to leading models — or risking total dependency on Sam Altman’s whims — would be even pricier. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcq4eeb779reze56f5wpvz))

First, there is the fact that AI is not disruptive for any of Amazon’s businesses; if anything, they all benefit. Increased AWS usage is obvious, but also Amazon.com could be a huge beneficiary of customers using AI for product recommendations ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcqr5pjaab525rrjyp4e18))

Second, AWS’s partnership with Anthropic also seems much more stable than Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI. ChatGPT obviously drives a ton of Azure usage, but it’s also [the core reason why OpenAI and Microsoft’s conflict was inevitable](https://stratechery.com/2025/stargate-the-end-of-microsoft-and-openai/); ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcr5f6paaf902jazvb27w3))

I do think that ChatGPT has won the consumer AI space, and is more likely to extend its dominance than to be supplanted. This, by extension, puts OpenAI fundamentally at conflict with any other entity that seeks to own the customer relationship, from Microsoft to Apple. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcv4f8qbthtvge3g6trfse))

The big question in my mind is when and if OpenAI figures out an advertising model to supplement its subscription business. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcw860xtbbp1ad6wvzcfgm))

**Anthropic:** Anthropic may have missed out on the consumer space, but the company’s focus on coding has paid off in a very strong position with developers and a big API revenue stream. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcwvqsw7sjc7n49cqbhg15))

Anthropic is seeking to ameliorate that risk with products like Code that can not only be a business in its own right, but also generate critical data for improving the underlying model. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfcx4w8tvhmsnsn5y8xh4j3))

What may end up happening — and [DeepSeek pointed in this direction](https://stratechery.com/2025/deepseek-faq/) — is that China ends up commoditizing both chips and AI; if that happened it’s Big Tech that would benefit the most ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jyfd2z01jaz53ge35h81dv1q))
