## Summary
The system that separates great from mediocre AI writing

## Highlights
The failure forced a choice: Quit or learn to write from the ground up. That shame—the guilt and feeling of not being good enough—pushed me to spend the next few years studying and deconstructing persuasive writing. Without the intuition of a native speaker, I took the methodical approach of an engineer. I built arguments from first principles because I had no other choice.
That painful experience taught me a lesson that’s more relevant today than ever: Scaling production without scaling human judgment is a recipe for disaster. This is the trap most people are falling into with AI. The system I was forced to build to overcome my own shortcomings is the same system that can help you create great work with AI.

If you want to get good writing—at scale—with AI, you need to also provide it with the strategic raw materials first (what AI researcher **Andrej Karpathy** and [others](https://every.to/working-overtime/i-fed-my-essays-to-chatgpt-until-it-learned-my-voice) call [context engineering](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1937902205765607626?lang=en)). Instead of simply telling the AI the audience is “VPs of finance,” you supply it with customer interview transcripts that reveal their pains and priorities. Instead of describing the voice as “confident,” you feed it a brand voice guide with clear examples of what to do and what to avoid. You’re building a rich, data-informed world for the AI to operate within, not just giving it a better list of instructions.

Prompt engineering focuses on crafting specific but rigid commands. Word something the wrong way and you’re back to square one, tweaking phrases and hoping for a better result. Context engineering is more flexible. Once you provide the necessary context and foundation, you can steer the AI with more human, conversational instructions.

While my examples come from copywriting, this architectural approach isn’t limited to marketing—it can be a universal blueprint for any kind of knowledge work. The process of engineering context remains the same even when the inputs and outputs change.
Let’s say you’re a founder preparing for a board meeting. You don’t ask an AI for a pitch deck. You *observe* by gathering market research, competitive analysis, and investor feedback. You *distill* that information into a clear business strategy with concrete growth goals. Only then can you ask the AI to *crystallize* that strategy into a compelling narrative for the presentation, confident that the output will be grounded in business realities.

The pattern holds true elsewhere. For a novelist, observing is world-building and character development; distilling is creating plot summaries and character sheets. For a researcher, observing is the literature review and raw data; distilling is the methodology and outline. In both cases, the AI can only crystallize a scene or summarize findings once that deep context has been built. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6xxm3bwxfczcmzzk12z93kr))

In every case, you get the most value by first building a world for the AI to think inside of. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6xxmcfh66xzpjbp2sy4zs7j))

After all these years, the sentence in that client email—“these articles are crap”—has stayed with me. It’s a reminder that great writing is meant to create value, not simply produce words. And that requires a lot of foundational work.
The best-run organizations have always known this. They treat storytelling as the output of deep research and strategy. Take Slack’s early homepage headline [“Be less busy”](https://medium.com/swlh/slack-copywriting-what-they-say-to-9-6-million-pageviews-every-month-4351888f1c2c) or its memorable explainer video ["So Yeah, We Tried Slack …"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6zVzWU95Sw) video. Both came from listening to users who felt buried under email and context-switching.
That’s the part of the work that still creates the most value. What’s changed is that AI has made the final execution—the words themselves—cheap and instant. The temptation is to treat this as a shortcut, a cheap way to automate and scale. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6xxng4qwmahk1cmzr09gadt))
