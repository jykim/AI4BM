Position yourself where AI multiplies your value instead of replacing it

Here’s the humbling truth: The market no longer rewards credentials, effort, or experience. It rewards relevance. And relevance is a moving target. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2cw8npt4nh3q00gdkck7pw3))

The standard advice—“learn AI engineering,” “build automations”—isn’t wrong, but it’s not enough. Those are tactics for today’s market. If AI keeps accelerating, those tactics will expire fast. Here’s some better advice: Position yourself where AI can’t easily reach—where your skills are both scarce *and* make the technology more useful.

To understand how AI is reshaping work, we need to stop thinking in terms of jobs and start thinking in terms of tasks.
Most people treat a job as a title: product manager, software engineer, marketing director. But every job is really a bundle of tasks. A product manager might run sprints, write specs, lead meetings, analyze metrics, and interview users. Each of those tasks has its own supply, demand, and susceptibility to automation.

When technology shifts, it doesn’t eliminate entire jobs overnight; it targets individual tasks. Your job’s future depends on how automatable the pieces of your task bundle are. Economists have found that [partial automation can increase employment](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/8E5639CE583F586A8096A01A8D072290/S1365100521000031a.pdf/automation-partial-and-full.pdf) by boosting productivity and creating new tasks to manage emerging bottlenecks. But once automation crosses a tipping point—when most or all tasks in a role can be automated—those jobs start to vanish. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2cwb7eg1c85zcbk7nm3kr3q))

So how do you anticipate which tasks are safe, and which ones will disappear? The key is understanding two forces: scarcity and complementarity.
“Scarcity” refers to the relative supply and demand of labor required to complete that task. As AI gets better at certain tasks—analysing data, summarizing, coding—the “labor” to complete those tasks becomes (infinitely) abundant. So wages drop and jobs disappear. On the flip side, skills that are hard to automate become relatively scarce and therefore more valuable.
“Complementarity” refers to skills that make AI more useful. Skills that complement AI include knowing how to [prompt an LLM well,](https://every.to/p/the-ultimate-guide-to-prompt-engineering) layering AI into real-world workflows, and interpreting and critiquing AI outputs. These skills don’t compete with AI. They enhance it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k2cwcky7m0xf2exxxe9k9bjd))

**Why bother?** While AI is most effective at automating narrow, repetitive tasks, it’s less capable of stitching those tasks together into a coherent whole. A full-stack professional knows how to *orchestrate*—they use AI to handle discrete components, while maintaining oversight and strategic control across the entire workflow.

**Marketing professional**
1. Core cluster: Content creation, campaign management, SEO
2. Neighboring clusters: Data analytics (for campaign insights), UX design (for content usability), web development (for landing pages) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6xwk662jma76yge18jw1pzc))
