## Summary
Transparency, disclosure, and publication-level guidelines

## Highlights
The clear first step for us around AI-generated content is related to transparency and disclosure, and so we’ve [updated our distribution standards to include an AI-specific guideline](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006362473-Medium-s-Distribution-Standards-What-Writers-and-Publications-Need-to-Know):
> We welcome the responsible use of AI-assistive technology on Medium. To promote transparency, and help set reader expectations, we require that any story created with AI assistance be clearly labeled as such. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k1e15qf2s9em4h2ren4yw69k))

So for now, when we encounter content that we believe is AI-generated but not disclosed, we won’t [distribute it across Medium’s network](https://help.medium.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018677974). We may revisit this decision down the road, but for now, asking for disclosure feels like the right first step. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k1e170mk9a61hvj30x40nyk3))

Towards Data Science, “[A Note about AI-Generated Text](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-note-about-ai-generated-text-4ce3be86f599)”
> We’re committed to publishing work by human authors only, and why we don’t — and won’t — accept posts written in whole or in part by AI tools.
Fanfare’s [official stance on AI stories](https://medium.com/fan-fare/fanfares-official-stance-on-ai-stories-87e55c63948):
> Any aspiring writers who submits AI content will be barred at the gates like the uncivilized barbarians they are. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k1e185t6ac7yttpqth25g9pt))

The Writing Cooperative’s [Submission Requirements and Style Guide](https://writingcooperative.com/the-writing-cooperative-submission-requirements-364b0fea36cd#81c5):
> Do not submit anything written solely using a generative AI tool. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k1e18t24efqq454znpx9vbdc))
