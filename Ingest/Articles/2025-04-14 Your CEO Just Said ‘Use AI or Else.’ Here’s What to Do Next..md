## Summary
Shopify’s viral company memo made AI a workplace expectation. This is your step-by-step guide to mastering AI at work.

## Highlights
Here’s how most people approach AI: They read articles. Bookmark prompt guides. Open ChatGPT, type “help me be productive,” get a meh response, and close the tab. Repeat until morale improves.
But the only real way to get better at using AI is to use it regularly, imperfectly, without overthinking it. 
The first step is to invite AI to the table—literally. Keep ChatGPT open in a browser tab. Download the desktop app. If you have an iPhone, program your Action button to [launch ChatGPT's voice assistant](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-program-your-iphones-action-button-to-summon-chatgpts-voice-assistant/) with one press. The goal is to make AI feel like a teammate sitting next to you, ready to jump in. Like a new teammate, they may be awkward at first. They may misread your tone or do things slightly wrong. But over time, you learn how to work together.
Pick something you already do—writing a weekly update, sorting tasks, summarizing calls—and try doing it with AI:
• Use Claude to clean up meeting notes.
• Ask ChatGPT to rewrite a bug or support ticket for clarity.
• Try Cursor to refactor repetitive code. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrv1fzysvm2z8whsr1zj7z1d))

One trick: Have AI ask you questions first. Instead of just saying “rewrite this,” give it a prompt, like, “Interview me about my goals for this project,” and let it interview you. That back-and-forth helps it understand what you actually need. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrv1gcefax3cjy880yx7p433))

Before AI can multiply your work, you need to know what’s worth multiplying.
This is where a lot of people get tripped up. They open a new AI tool and ask, “What can you do?” Instead, start with: “What do I do that matters—to me and to my team?”
If you’re not clear on how you create value—what you’re good at, what your team counts on you for—you risk using AI to generate filler: more words, noise, or decks no one asked for. But if you know your edge, AI becomes a point of leverage.
Try writing on a blank piece of paper or in an [Obsidian note](https://obsidian.md/):
• What would your team miss if you disappeared for a week?
• What problems do people ask you to help solve?
• What feels easy for you but hard for others?
• What do you, yourself, want to accomplish?
Now pick one of those strengths and ask: How could AI help me do this faster, better, or in a different way than I could have before? Generic AI usage leads to generic results. Push yourself to put your subject matter expertise into words. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrv1ff1vr53xszgehgpe514b))

If there’s one underrated unlock for getting more out of AI, it’s this: Write things down.
Not for posterity, but for performance. When you combine good documentation with AI, you’re not just saving time—you’re setting up automation.
Think of it like training a new teammate. If you bark vague orders at them—“Do marketing!” “Fix it!”—they’ll flail. But if you give them structure, examples, and context, they’ll understand how to do the job you’re asking of them. The same goes for AI. The people who get the most out of it aren't technical wizards. It’s the clear communicators, managers, and leaders who know how to give good instructions and learn from results.
AI thrives on clarity. It needs structure to do its best work. That structure comes from the context you give it: the way you outline your workflows, capture your steps, and define what “done” looks like.
The next time you are doing something you do often—writing a changelog, triaging bugs, launching a campaign— write down:
• What kicks off your process?
• What steps do you take?
• What does a “good” output look like?
This last point—defining what "good" means—is one of the most critical roles humans play in an AI-powered world. "Good" is deeply contextual and often subjective. What makes a good customer response? What makes a good product feature? What makes a good strategy document? These aren't universal constants. They're shaped by you, your company's values, your team's needs, and your customers' expectations. AI can help you get there faster, but you need to know where "there" is.

The most important thing is creating reusable context, because that document becomes:
• A ready-made AI prompt
• A prototype brief
• An onboarding document for a new teammate
• A starting point for automation
Good documentation turns one-off experiments into repeatable processes, and repeatable processes into opportunities for automation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrv1hh8k7gy6jssqs705dk44))

Block one hour this week to review how you’ve used AI in the past month and ask yourself:
• What have I used AI for more than once?
• What worked especially well?
• What took less time than it used to?
Then ask: Can I turn this into a repeatable thing?
• A Claude or ChatGPT prompt template?
• A Slackbot that handles a recurring task?
• A Notion button that auto-generates your weekly update?
• A product that makes you a custom podcast each day?
If it worked once, it can work 10 times, and if it works 10 times, it’s probably worth sharing—or automating. Just make sure it's worth building according to the value you defined in step two. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrv1mgdwqwksdbtrhf8mz840))

In a company in which employees are learning something new at scale, early transparency becomes leadership. When you share what you’re trying—even if it’s messy—you give your teammates a blueprint, or at the very least, permission to try something themselves.
Pick one thing—an AI-powered workflow, a lesson learned, or a prompt that surprised you—and post it in a public Slack or Discord channel. Or run a 15-minute “here’s what I tried” session at your next team meeting. It doesn’t have to be formal—your goal is to show your process, not just your outcomes. These show-and-tell sessions create vital bridges: The people closest to the problems can explain their needs and solutions, while technical teams can identify opportunities to automate and scale what's working.
Sharing your experiments builds trust and visibility. When performance reviews include questions about AI usage (as Lutke says they will), you won’t be guessing at answers. You’ll have receipts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jrv4c8v8gk2ba9rtcvb0v5jy))

There’s also [voice mode](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/review-chatgpt-s-new-advanced-voice-mode). ChatGPT’s mobile app makes it easy to talk things out from wherever you are. On your Mac, tools like [Wispr Flow](http://wisprflow.ai/r/HERO2) let you build voice-driven workflows that feel natural.
