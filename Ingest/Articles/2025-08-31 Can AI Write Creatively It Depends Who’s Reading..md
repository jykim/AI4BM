## Summary
GPT-5 sharpens the question, but the answer remains in our hands

## Highlights
When we judge whether AI can write creatively, we’re really expressing our own beliefs about what creativity is—not something many of us spend much time thinking about. We may think we know it when we see it, but putting “it” into words is surprisingly difficult. Is originality an illusion, a deft trick of taking in data about the world and parsing and rearranging it? Or is it rooted in some ineffable aspect of human experience? Or is it something else entirely: a subjective judgment that’s open to interpretation by whomever is interacting with the creative work?

Boden theorized that creativity came in three broad types: “combinational” creativity, improbably combining familiar ideas (a chef who prepares dishes that are a fusion of Spanish and Thai cuisines); “exploratory” creativity, discovering new ideas within a familiar conceptual space (a chef at the cutting edge of contemporary Spanish food); and “transformational” creativity, changing some dimension of a familiar space so that new structures can arise (a chef [reimagining](https://uncertaintymindset.org/) what constitutes *food*).

Somewhat amazingly, research [published](https://arxiv.org/html/2304.00008v5#abstract) just last month that used Boden’s criteria to evaluate the current generation of LLMs reached a similar conclusion. The authors conclude that at best, LLMs are capable of exploratory and combinational creativity. Transformational creativity, according to them, remains out of reach because of the models’ autoregressive nature—in other words, the property of LLMs to generate text one token at a time, with each new token being informed by all previously generated tokens. In case you’re wondering what transformational creativity in writing looks like when humans do it, one prominent example is **James Joyce**’s *Ulysses*. In the book, Joyce pioneered a stream-of-consciousness style that broke traditional narrative structures and redefined what a novel could be.

Writing has long [been thought of](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/11/books/a-terrible-beauty-is-born-how.html) as a mysterious thing that’s [peculiar to humans](https://www.persuasion.community/p/why-ai-will-never-rival-human-creativity), an alchemy of one’s thoughts, experiences, emotions, and observations that moves people who read it. It’s usually talked about in terms of being a struggle. **Virginia Wool**f, who to put it mildly thought a *lot* about the writing process, [said](https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/11/books/a-terrible-beauty-is-born-how.html), “The main thing in beginning a novel is to feel, not that you can write it, but that it exists on the far side of a gulf, which words can't cross: that it's to be pulled through only in breathless anguish.”
Most in the trade agree that writing is indeed a struggle, and one intimately linked to the larger struggle of living. It is, as singer-songwriter **[Nick Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Cave)** [put it](https://www.theredhandfiles.com/chat-gpt-what-do-you-think/), “a blood and guts business, here at my desk.” “ChatGPT’s melancholy role is that it is destined to imitate and can never have an authentic human experience,” Cave continued, while responding to a fan who sent him a song that ChatGPT had generated in his style.

Traditionally in literature, the author is celebrated as a unique creative genius, the sole originator of a work’s meaning. Post-modernist thinkers challenged this view—arguing that the meaning of a text comes from the reader’s interpretation, not the writer’s intent​. In his prescient 1986 essay ["Cybernetics and Ghosts,"](https://www.jfki.fu-berlin.de/academics/SummerSchool/Dateien2011/Reading_Assignments/iuli_reader2.pdf) surrealist writer **Italo Calvino** dreams of machines capable of writing, and in that eventuality, describes how literature will abound: “Once we have dismantled and reassembled the process of literary composition, the decisive moment of literary life will be that of reading. In this sense, even though entrusted to machines, literature will continue to be a ‘place’ of privilege within the human consciousness… The work will continue to be born, to be judged, to be destroyed or constantly renewed on contact with the eye of the reader.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k410mv24x25mgzf0z3sz9c67))

I started research on this piece with the hopes of answering what I thought was a binary question: Either LLMs could write creatively, or they couldn’t. But my honest conclusion is that creativity exists on a spectrum. Like many things that intrigue and beguile us—love, consciousness, intelligence—it defies straightforward definitions. Language models *are* creative, and have been for many decades—if you see creativity in the processes of combination and exploration, or if you believe meaning, ultimately, resides in the reader's interpretation. But if you believe that true creativity requires lived human experience, unconscious incubation, or a fundamentally new way of thinking, LLMs still have ways to go. As we question whether an AI can truly write, reason, or create, it seems that we’re compelled to define our own abilities more precisely than ever before.
