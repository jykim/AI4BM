## Highlights
The reason why I think that's so important is because whatever happens in that moment, I've found, is when I'm the most neuroplastic. My brain is able to let go of its map or construct of the world and reorient itself to some new reality. I've often found that when I'm truly in flow, I come out of it and it feels like I just went through some deep meditation.

What I learned in my physical experience is that so much of my reality is defined entirely in my mind, from that phantom limb pain to whether or not this is a big catastrophe in my life to whether or not it's one of the greatest gifts in my life.
