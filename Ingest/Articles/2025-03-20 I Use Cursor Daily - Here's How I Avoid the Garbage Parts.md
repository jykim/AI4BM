## Summary
hello i'm nick

## Highlights
The reason for shitty AI output is not because it forgot about DRY or SOLID. And I find that giving it too much input, and having longer chats, is when it starts to fall apart a bit. So keep it light.
And here's the thing: if you notice the same issues popping up again and again, just add a quick line telling it not to. Or even better, in your cursor chat just say "please write me a cursorrule so that you stop doing this particular thing." And then chuck it in there.

I have found *by far* the best thing for improving the output is telling it exactly where to find the code it might otherwise spit out at you.
Like if you know it's going to need a certain function, or create a procedure very similar to something that exists, give it that context. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jptnkz9626cx1t8j97bc61n2))

• Don't blindly accept code. It's always gonna come back to bite you. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jptnmyr77xncz7w2kxek4q4x))

Every so often make sure you read and fully understand the most integral parts of your code, and refactor it *manually.* ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jptnnczm6ykd5xygmexcmk2r))

⁠Ask "is this the best way to do this?" or "have you considered xyz". ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jptnnnjw98rmajxpzp7jyje8))

Take extra care when using AI to fix bugs. I think it's particularly weak at fixing anything but the silliest of bugs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jptnp29cbzvj3rybyc2epzv1))

• If it's a big and important task or you are setting the foundations for a feature, ask it to ask you any questions before writing code to make sure it has a full understanding of what you are trying to do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jptnpcwh0qfeexz8jax3wes8))

It's great for sitting on the couch and cranking out some mostly decent code, but then other days of course you just spend an hour chasing "You're right" "I see the issue now" only to end up in a worse place than you started.
