## Summary
Our ability to remember changes with age. Memories are there, but they are not so accessible. With the arrival of Limitless AI that could soon become a thing of the past.

## Highlights
Limitless, which Siroker cofounded with Brett Bejcek, has applications for business, productivity, etc., and beyond work, for family life. “It helps me be a better dad,” he says “Every morning, I get a push notification from the app that looks at everything I've said, everything I've heard, how I've interacted with my kids, and gives me concrete examples of things I could have done better or differently. That kind of life coach capability is only possible when you have something that captures what's going on throughout your day.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzzhttj2mwj9bt0sb1g8hxv0))

Hudson says: “Having a meeting assistant that could deliver high-quality notes for my weekly 70 to 80 meetings would be useful in helping me manage the cognitive load of keeping track of what was said, by whom, and what things I had committed to do. When I invested in Limitless, while there were other meeting assistant tools in the market, I didn’t feel any of them had this vision of perfect memory across so many aspects of personal and professional life.

“While Dan talks about it as a perfect memory, I think about it as a perfect presence; with the pendant on, I don't have to worry about taking notes or writing things down because the pendant will catch it all.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzzhvjw24rkk4bhskm8vnxh6))

He says: “The first day I wore it was over the Easter weekend. I wasn’t working and spent the day doing things with the children, going to the playground, coloring, and handling tantrums. The next day, I got a notification from Limitless summarizing my day, including moments where I could’ve been more patient.
“That’s when it clicked. The pendant was capturing all the small, meaningful moments that are easy to forget; moments that photos alone can’t preserve. It was like a digital diary. It’s now part of my daily routine, especially valuable during mornings and evenings with my kids.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzzhwyqx1219bebgat7s5p5m))
