## Summary
The research-focused agent shows how a new generation of more capable AI models could automate some office tasks.

## Highlights
Because Deep Research was trained to analyze and summarize human-written text, Tobin says his team was surprised to see many people using it to generate code. “It’s an interesting thread to pull,” he says. “We’re not totally sure what to make of it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpvmmvah03dymf9be1qay7zk))

Tobin admits, however, that the tool still has important blind spots. “It may struggle with distinguishing authoritative information from rumors,” he says. “It currently shows a weakness in confidence calibration, often failing to convey uncertainty accurately."

OpenAI hired graduate students and other highly skilled professionals to help train Deep Research. These users give queries and then correct mistakes, providing training data for a reinforcement learning algorithm that lets the model learn to become a better research assistant.
