## Summary
The Rosebud app stunned me with its insights.

## Highlights
Once you complete an entry, Rosebud can get into its groove. First comes a summary of what you just shared, laced with validations, minor insights, and new prompts. For example, if you're worried about work deadlines competing with parental obligations, Rosebud will say it understands, acknowledge that the situation is challenging, and may ask something like, "What would help you feel accomplished?" and "How do you envision your evening unfolding if both your goals and your child's needs are met?"
Without AI, it's easy to imagine an analog journal entry about the same scenario providing the writer a chance to at least prepare themselves for the day ahead, and potentially practice self-compassion or another coping skill. But with AI, there's dynamism that can lead to that improved self-awareness that Bader and Dadashi say they are so determined to provide.

What's perhaps most valuable about Rosebud is that it doesn't try to problem-solve on users' behalf. Bader and Dadashi say this is intentional. The approach is drawn directly from their own personal experiences in individual therapy and men's groups, where they had to learn skills like active listening and validation, and subdue the impulse to explain or give advice to someone.
"Rather than trying to replace human thinking, [Rosebud] is trying to help you think more deeply, and feel more deeply," says Dadashi. "You can't grow if someone's telling you what to do, or giving you all the answers." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jqff8wx477gpdxs0e474cvby))

Yet he can see a potential downside if users become reliant on a platform like Rosebud, turning to it instead of a loved one, or becoming so engaged with the technology that they stop doing other important things, like exercise and sleep.

But there are other considerations. Eichstaedt says this includes the possibility that AI journaling apps may create an "echo chamber" for people with serious mental illness like obsessive compulsive disorder and schizophrenia. He notes that because an AI assistant is typically instructed to be helpful, it may unwittingly reinforce harmful thought patterns or behaviors.

The real test will be if this journaling habit sticks for the long run, since we know that most people abandon mental health and well-being apps within weeks of starting them. My personal growth might plateau, too. But I actually look forward to finding out, because who knows what Rosebud will help me learn about myself along the way.
