## Summary
The search giant should’ve been first to the chatbot revolution. It wasn’t. So it punched back with late nights, layoffs—and lowering some guardrails.

## Highlights
Hsiao called the moment “an innocent mistake.” Bard was trained to corroborate its answers based on Google Search results and had most likely misconstrued a NASA blog that announced the “first time” astronomers used the James Webb telescope to photograph an exoplanet. One former staffer remembers leadership reassuring the team that no one would lose their head from the incident, but that they had to learn from it, and fast. “We're Google, we're not a startup,” Hsiao says. “We can't as easily say, ‘Oh, it's just the flaw of the technology.’ We get called out, and we have to respond the way Google needs to respond.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpy7197d7hvpxb2bhwsj14ez))

As the new project sucked up what resources Google could spare, AI researchers who worked in areas such as health care and climate change strained for servers and lost morale. Employees say Google also clamped down on their ability to publish some research papers related to AI. Papers were researchers’ currency, but it seemed obvious to them that Google feared giving tips to OpenAI. The recipe for training Gemini was too valuable to be stolen. This needed to be the model that would save Google from obsolescence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jpy765h7r9vn09x0geh853cn))

And Google faces one challenge that its competitors don’t: In the coming years, up to a quarter of its search ad revenue could be lost to antitrust judgments, [according to JP Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth](https://qz.com/google-antitrust-lawsuit-loss-search-revenue-apple-1851614353). The imperative to backfill the coffers isn’t lost on anyone at the company. Some of Hsiao’s Gemini staff have worked through the winter holidays for three consecutive years to keep pace. Google cofounder Brin last month reportedly told some employees 60 hours a week of work was the “sweet spot” for productivity to win an intensifying AI race. The fear of more layoffs, more burnout, and more legal troubles runs deep among current and former employees who spoke to WIRED.
