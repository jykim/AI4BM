## Summary
Former Stripe and Google exec Alex Komoroske on designing technology that goes beyond what you want right now

## Highlights
For Komoroske, intentional technology rests on four pillars. It must be:
1. human-centered, serving the individual rather than the corporation
2. private by design, so data remains under the user’s control
3. pro-social, encouraging people to meaningfully integrate with society
4. open-ended, letting anyone build new experiences on top of the technology (instead of a single corporation gatekeeping optionality) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzqy7b90wxa411z5qqf8v670))

Komoroske has a couple of ideas about how we can break the stalemate. One way is to return to how desktop software used to work, a file system-like model, where different apps can access the same user data. The other, more advanced solution involves confidential computing. In this setup, your data runs in a secure enclave in the cloud—fully encrypted and inaccessible even to the company that hosts it. (Komoroske has a full piece on this coming soon—keep an eye out to hear more from him.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzqyhwceqjr65ydsx0tadsz2))
