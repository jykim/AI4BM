## Summary
There's a difference between obstacles and the struggle that makes you better. Here's how to tell.

## Highlights
Trial, error, filling skill gaps, honing hand and eye: it was reinforcement learning built through thousands of small decisions I'd been forced to defend or abandon. I carried this mindset to my design work at Apple, Google Maps, and later my own startup, Oyster.
But friction, once an indispensable process of building competency and perspective, is vanishing to AI. A single prompt generates polished landing pages, completes brand systems, and ships working applications. The fruit that once required long, arduous labor now drops directly into our laps, ripe yet uncannily hollow. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxwxq0r4hgjpybh64bs04sn))

Knowledge risks becoming merely transactional, a commodity to be accessed, rather than relational or internalized. Information on tap instead of an ongoing dialogue with ourselves and the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxwzadvfkcf3dqkawcqagtv))

But we must recognize the distinction between that and what I call *productive friction.* This is the kind of difficulty that’s worth preserving, the kind of struggle that pushes you forward as you push against it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxwznxj2a07wrmy2pv0sndm))

**The path of more resistance**
Productive friction has three main principles:
1. **Immediate feedback:** You understand when you've failed and can see why.
2. **Cumulative learning:** Each attempt builds your reference library.
3. **Transferable principles:** The specific teaches the general. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx0fxfpzy6ge3y09v281ed))

Taste is often held up as an irreducibly human thing, the [saving grace](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/what-i-do-when-i-can-t-sleep) of our uniqueness in the AI age. But taste isn’t something anyone is born with or even a deterministic goal. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx228ke1yzd0ga50nce7bh))

Taste isn’t any one thing. It is *your* thing. And it’s a product of friction.

Friction isn't inefficiency to be eliminated. It's the resistance necessary to build genuine judgment and refine taste. Its value doesn't lie in the final product but in the work itself. AI allows production without labor, creating the illusion of progress while sidestepping much of the actual learning. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx41vgt0znjmk4anq2w8gc))

**Friction forces articulation.** In those RISD critiques, “I just liked it better” meant blank stares and humiliation. I learned to identify and name what I was seeing: the way warm gray advances while cool gray recedes, how a curve that accelerates too quickly feels anxious and disjoint. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx58ccca6ygseneqjma6ng))

Friction also **develops conviction through contestation**. When peers attacked my composition, defending successful elements while acknowledging weak points taught me to distinguish personal preference from universal principles. This conviction becomes a position you can articulate clearly beyond “I like it.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx6nt0wtshr30wg8mv409j))

The solution isn't to abandon AI but to be intentional about where friction remains and matters. In my own work, I am constantly using AI (as much as possible); it would be stubborn and short-sighted not to. But like any tool or collaborator, it requires thoughtful restraint and careful judgment of when to engage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx79pvabcpjnhf7t6mmced))

Before starting a project, I clarify what kind of answer I actually need. AI can instantly deliver plausible solutions, but are those solutions meaningful, or just comfortably convincing? When approaching design, I first sketch by hand to avoid tool-driven thinking, and ensure simplicity and clarity from the start. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx8429d96ee5sbfb144rzc))

When writing, I commit to an initial full draft—raw and messy if necessary—before seeking AI-assisted refinements. Most critically, when learning something new, I go straight to primary sources rather than settling for summaries or shortcuts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx8f93wty9kckqk0gfefhc))

This intentional friction keeps my thinking sharp and ensures that when I do engage with automation, I do so from a place of genuine understanding and deliberate choice.

How do we recognize genuine expertise now? For generations, we’ve looked to credentials, like degrees attained and company names on resumes. Increasingly, the proof is in the outputs: visible friction, evidence of struggle, and personal investment made tangible. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxxambwkbxm0sd0pgyd299b))

Today, it's harder for many to find a first job, yet never easier to [create your first opportunity](https://every.to/thesis/knowledge-work-is-dying-here-s-what-comes-next). Human labor is shifting toward adept humans leveraging AI to accomplish vastly more. In this emerging world, proof of work replaces credentials and titles. What matters is what you've made or shipped, not what degrees you have or where you got them. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxx9z1fsm7s77j3k3rt5fyx))

How do you do this work? Simple: Do it. Try lots of things, fast. Bring people along with what you are doing. Instead of trying to climb some arbitrary career ladder, consider following experiments and ideas that draw you in. Every hour spent wrestling with software, every failed print run, every brutal critique creates part of a foundation that you’ll later need to place bigger bets and call bolder shots.

The world divides in two. On one side: utility, stripped of mystery, measured in speed, cost, and precision. Frictionless. On the other: meaning, full of ambiguity, judged by story, risk, and personal intent. AI is conquering the first. It should. Let it drive the bus, draft the forms, color-correct the photo, and sand [some of the rougher edges](https://every.to/working-overtime/how-to-keep-your-writing-weird-in-the-age-of-ai). Then you can focus on what matters. Preserve friction where it counts, not as nostalgia or high-minded purism, but as method and meaning. This approach will better prepare us to work successfully in the AI age. Offload the boring. Keep the stakes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jzxxc37wz92n4x2dx4stqmw8))

Years later, I finally understood my professor’s lesson. The point wasn't to produce flawless art; it was to develop the judgment that can only come from having your hands in the material and experiencing intentional struggle.
