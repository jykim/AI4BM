## Summary
Discover the extraordinary logistics behind the Verbier Festival, where a world-class classical music event is built from scratch every year.

## Highlights
The greatest logistical effort attached to the main venues is for the Salle de Combins, home since 2010 to the symphonic and operatic performances in particular. Built afresh each year, this temporary hall may look like a gigantic marquee, but is in fact a solid structure boasting 12cm-thick acoustically treated walls, and a similarly acoustically treated roof consisting of two layers separated by an air pocket, over which fine netting is suspended to break the speed – and thus, crucially, the sound – of any falling rain.

Not only does this hall take around 50 people a month to construct, but each year its construction is slightly different, as Engstroem and his co-CEO since 2024 Hervé Boissière dream up new ideas. This year, for instance, sees the addition of a pavilion where a new-look pre-concert interview series will take place; also a viewing room where festival-goers can watch performances from the Verbier Festival video archive on a wall-size screen.
