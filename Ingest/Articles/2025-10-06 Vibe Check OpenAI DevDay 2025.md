## Highlights
As a day-to-day user, I will only use an app inside of ChatGPT if it is *at least as fast* as using that app in a separate interface. I know this because we’ve been experimenting with experiences like this for some of our products. For example, we built an alpha feature for **[Sparkle](https://makeitsparkle.co)** that allows you to search the files on your computer from within Claude. You might input, “Grab the contract I just downloaded and summarize what it says,” without switching out of Claude.
This seems like a good idea in theory, but in practice, it’s so much faster to use the Sparkle native app to find a file. No one used the feature, so we didn’t ship it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k6xwpz7tcqj5r1cz03981zrd))
