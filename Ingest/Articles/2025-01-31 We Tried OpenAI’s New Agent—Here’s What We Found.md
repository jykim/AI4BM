## Summary
Operator (Could you help me do this task?)

## Highlights
This is a task that OpenAI’s o1 would do much better at given the same information—*but* o1 doesn’t have the ability to autonomously perform tasks yet. And this gives you a sense for how OpenAI is thinking about Operator so far. The company is focused on making it great for performing repetitive workflows automatically and less focused on other aspects of its intelligence.

One of the most impressive things about Operator is that it can do lengthy tasks on its own with minimal prompting. For example, we had it perform a task that took more than 20 minutes: We asked it to help us understand how Spotify Wrapped has evolved over the years. What did it start out as? What does it include now that’s new? It needed a little encouragement here and there to keep going, but it ended up eventually accomplishing the task it had been set. This is a significant improvement from the agentic experiences of 12 or even six months ago that would frequently go off the rails after only a few seconds.

OpenAI is going back to the original strategy that worked so well with ChatGPT: Release early and often, even when there are rough edges. Not only that, but release consumer products rather than just APIs.
This is dramatically different from where OpenAI started, and it differs from what competitors like Anthropic are doing. Anthropic also has an autonomous agent, Claude Computer use, but that’s only been [released](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use) as an API, so adoption has been fairly limited.
