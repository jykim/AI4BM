## Summary
OpenAI has launched Codex, an autonomous programming agent designed to assist with various coding tasks. This tool aims to improve efficiency in software development by helping users write code more effectively. Codex can suggest features and automate tasks, making programming easier and more productive.

## Highlights
Codex is it's a cloud-based software engineer that can work on like many tasks in parallel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvd7jx5gxm8tj8b5em3x2fyw))

And so we basically want to give the agent its own computer to do work in. And so as we started thinking about that um you know, you kind of realize, okay, this this feels a bit like delegation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jvd7m7er7tptnymn03bjmzz0))
