Can AI replace a human coach? In this video, I test NotebookLM as a life coach by feeding it 148,000+ words of deeply personal material - spanning 15+ years of journals, coaching notes, personality profiles, essays, and more - to uncover patterns, insights, and blind spots in my growth. Watch as I explore whether AI can offer meaningful, personalized coaching based on deep context.
