## Summary
CURRENTLY AI Search Whisperer IS UP

## Highlights
The hard to find answers are often hidden in technical documents, bureaucratic language, scientific research, complex corporate communication, or dense financial reports. I always open up some of these documents and try to figure out what the pattern is. I write “reasons for dementia”, but a scientist writes "etiologies of dementia". That’s a mismatch by default if you don’t speak the lingo. I should have typed “etiologies of dementia” in the very first place.

If so, I like to try to “think like a document”, - I wrote a few books about that subject. In stead of typing “invention basketball”, I type “basketball was invented in”. In stead of typing “future plan”, I type “2024…2039”. It’s a time range : search for *all* the years in that range. In stead “how many children does Putin have” , I type “Putin has * children” site:bbc.com to predict how a news organization would phrase the answer. In stead of typing **Why?** I use **because** in my search query. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01jmsws5rf8rqxbebn7h2q008w))
