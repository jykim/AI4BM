This course is taught entirely inside Claude Code itself 😈

- You’ll install it, clone this repository, then type `/start-1-1` to begin
- Claude guides you through each module interactively
- You learn by doing real PM work with real files

## Who This Course Is For

**Product Managers** who want to learn the most powerful way to use LLMs for work.

Claude Code isn’t a chatbot. It’s an AI that works directly with your files and computer:

- Reads your user research, edits PRDs, analyzes data
- Runs 10 instances in parallel to process 10 files simultaneously
- Remembers context about your product across every session
- Analyzes screenshots and mockups you paste
- Acts as custom AI reviewers (engineer, executive, UX) before you share work with your team

This is AI integrated into your actual workflow, not bolted on as a chat window.

**You don’t need coding or terminal experience.** If you can describe what you want in plain English, you can use Claude Code.

## What You’ll Learn

**Core Claude Code capabilities:**

- **File operations:** read, write, and edit documents directly from your terminal
- **Parallel agents:** launch multiple Claude instances to process files simultaneously
- **Custom sub-agents:** create specialized reviewers for different perspectives
- **Project memory:** use CLAUDE.md to maintain persistent context
- **@-mentions:** reference files and folders to give Claude full context
- **Image analysis:** paste screenshots and mockups for instant feedback

**Applied to real PM work:**

- Process meeting transcripts and extract action items
- Synthesize user research from multiple sources
- Write PRDs with multi-perspective feedback
- Analyze product data and run experiments
- Develop competitive strategy and create presentations
